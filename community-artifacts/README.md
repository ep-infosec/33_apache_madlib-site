The artifacts in this repo are intended to help you get started using Apache MADlib.

The Jupyter notebooks have been updated to work with Apache MADlib 1.17.  They may also work with previous releases.  Many of the workbooks are based on examples in the [MADlib user documentation](http://madlib.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html/).

If you would like to share any of your work with the Apache MADlib community, or correct/augment any of the artifacts that are here, you are most welcome to open a pull request.

See the project website [MADlib Home](http://madlib.apache.org/) for more information.
